### Jupyter notebooks

Hugo makes writing blogs in markdown very easy, but most of the things I consider writing a blog about involve code of some sort, so they usually fit well in a jupyter notebook. I also really like when a jupyter notebook is self contained an can be run in google colab. It's pretty straightforward to convert a jupyter notebook to markdown that hugo can use so here is just a brief protocol to follow to write blogs with jupyter notebooks.

1. Make sure the first markdown cell in the jupyter notebook has a colab badge

```markdown
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tijeco/personal_website/blob/master/content/post/name_of_blog_goes_here/name_of_blog_goes_here.ipynb)
```

2. Convert the notebook to a markdown file
```bash
jupyter nbconvert name_of_blog_goes_here.ipynb --to markdown --NbConvertApp.output_files_dir=.
```

```bash
mv name_of_blog_goes_here.md index.md
```


3. Make sure to add the hugo template header to the top of the markdown before pushing it to github

```markdown
---

Making updates may be a bit of a pain. So it is probably best to store the updated header in a  text file 

```bash
sed -n '/^---$/,/^---$/p'  index.md  > header.txt
```

Then when you update it you can append the headers back 

```bash
cat header.txt name_of_blog_goes_here.md > index.md
rm name_of_blog_goes_here.md
```
